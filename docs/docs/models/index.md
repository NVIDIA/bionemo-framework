# BioNeMo Framework: Available Models

State-of-the-art models are being continually integrated into the BioNeMo Framework. The available catalog consists of: 1) Models developed by NVIDIA, 2) Models contributed by NVIDIAâ€™s ecosystem partners, and 3) Community models further enhanced by NVIDIA to take advantage of GPU acceleration. The BioNeMo Framework currently offers the following pre-trained models:
