# Code Review

## Introduction

This document describes the process and etiquette for code review in the
BioNeMo repo. You should read this document if you are a developer
working in the BioNeMo repo.
The purpose of these guidelines is to help reduce the friction between
engineers writing code and those reviewing code. As with many rules,
there are exceptions. These exceptions are not comprehensive, so if you
find exceptions that should be listed, please raise them so they can be
evaluated for their inclusion.

## Code Review Process

The code review process is progressive:

1.  Review by your team
2.  Review by domain experts (CODEOWNERS)
3.  Approval by Approval-list users.
4.  (Optional) Coverage Check approval by Approval-list users.
