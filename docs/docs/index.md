# Getting Started

## Initializing 3rd-party dependencies as git submodules

For development, the NeMo and Megatron-LM dependencies are vendored in the bionemo-2 repository workspace as git
submodules. The pinned commits for these submodules represent the "last-known-good" versions of these packages that are
confirmed to be working with bionemo2 (and those that are tested in CI).

To initialize these sub-modules when cloning the repo, add the `--recursive` flag to the git clone command:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NVIDIA/bionemo-fw-ea.git
```

To download the pinned versions of these submodules within an existing git repository, run

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
