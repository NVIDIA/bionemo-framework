    "\n",
    "**ESM-2nv** is based on the public ESM-2 model, which is a BERT architecture trained on millions of protein sequences from the UniProt database. ESM-2nv learns the patterns and dependencies between amino acids that ultimately give rise to a proteinâ€™s 2D structure. These can include properties such as alpha helix or beta sheet, plus cellular location, thermostability, solubility, and other protein properties. For more information, you can check the [ESM2nv model card](../models/esm2-nv.md)\n",
