    "\n",
    "**MegaMolBART** is based on the BART architecture and trained on billions of SMILES from the ZINC15 database. MegaMolBART understands chemistry and is capable of producing embeddings that can be used for prediction of chemical properties and performing sequence translation tasks such as retrosynthesis prediction. Because MegaMolBART utilizes an autoregressive decoder, it can also generate molecules starting from a seed molecule.  "

    "The ZINC-15 database was used for training [[Sterling and Irwin, 2015]](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00559). Approximately 1.54 Billion molecules (SMILES strings) were selected from tranches meeting the following constraints: molecular weight <= 500 Daltons, LogP <= 5, reactivity level was “reactive,” and purchasability was “annotated.” The compounds were filtered to ensure a maximum length of 512 characters. Train, validation, and test splits were randomly split as 99% / 0.5% / 0.5%.\n",
