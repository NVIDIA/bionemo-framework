# Release Notes
## BioNeMo Framework v1.0
## New Models
* ESM-2nv for protein sequence representations, pretrained weights of ESM-2 650M and ESM-2 3B converted from HF checkpoint available.

### New Features
* Pre-training recipes for ESM-2nv, including automated data processing and full configuration for training
* Fine-tuning of ESM-2nv with encoder frozen or trainable
* Downstream task finetuning support for single-value classification (e.g. subcellular localization), single-value regression (e.g. meltome) and per-token classification (e.g. secondary structure) 
* Validation in loop to evaluate performance on downstream tasks during training
* Example tutorials for pre-training, fine tuning, and downstream tasks

## BioNeMo Framework v0.4.0
### New Models  
* ESM-1nv for protein sequence representations, pretrained weights available
* ProtT5nv for protein sequence representation and sequence-to-sequence tasks, pretrained weights available
### New Features
* Pre-training for all models, including automated data processing and full configuration for training
* Fine-tuning of MegaMolBART, ESM-1nv, and ProtT5nv with encoder frozen or trainable
* Downstream task example applications â€“ secondary structure prediction for ESM-1nv and ProtT5nv, physchem prediction (lipophilicity, FreeSolv, ESOL) and retrosynthesis prediction for MegaMolBART
* Validation in loop to evaluate performance on downstream tasks during training: physchem prediction (MegaMolBART) and secondary structure prediction (ESM-1nv and ProtT5nv).
* Pipeline parallelism supported as a beta feature. Not fully tested.
* Example notebooks for pre-training, fine tuning, and downstream tasks

### Known Issues
* Data preprocessing on DGX Cloud is slow. Faster to do it on a local machine.
### New APIs
* BioNeMoDataModule - Encapsulates dataset instantiation in bionemo models so that many different datasets can be used with the same model
* EncoderFineTuning - Base class to facilitate implementation of downstream tasks built on embeddings from other models
