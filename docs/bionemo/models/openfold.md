# OpenFold 
# Model Overview

## Description:
This is an OpenFold implementation under BioNeMo framework, derived from public OpenFold and DeepMind AlphaFold-2. This checkpoint was fine-tuned on the initial training checkpoint from the public OpenFold team.

OpenFold predicts protein structures from protein sequence inputs and optional multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and template(s). This implementation supports initial training, fine-tuning and inference under BioNeMo framework. Detailed examples can be found under `examples/protein/openfold` within BioNeMo framework repository.

Users are advised to read the licensing terms under [public OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) and [DeepMind AlphaFold-2](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) repositories as well as our copyright text.

This model is ready for commercial use. <br>
