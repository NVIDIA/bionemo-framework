# EquiDock

# Model Overview

## Description:
EquiDock [1] predicts protein-protein complex formation from two individual proteins.
EquiDock is an SE(3)-equivariant model that treats both the proteins as rigid bodies and assumes no conformational change during the formation of the complex.  This model is ready for commercial use. <br>

## Third-Party Community Consideration 
The original model was not owned or developed by NVIDIA. This model has been developed and built to a third-party’s requirements for this application and use case; see [GitHub](https://github.com/octavian-ganea/equidock_public) for more.

## Benchmarks

Two pretrained EquiDock checkpoints are available for download: `equidock_dips.nemo` and `equidock_db5.nemo`. These have been converted to the NeMo format from publicly available checkpoints. This section provides accuracy benchmarks for these models, as well as information on expected training speed performance. Currently, models trained from randomly initialized weights within the BioNeMo framework are not provided. The production of these models is ongoing work.

### Accuracy Benchmarks

The accuracy of EquiDock was measured using the complex and interface root-mean-squared distance {cite:p}`ganea2021independent`, which are measured over test datasets of DIPS and DB5.
