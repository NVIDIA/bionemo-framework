# DB5.5 Dataset

Docking Benchmark 5.5 ([DB5.5](https://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark/)) {cite:p}`vreven2015updates` is an updated and integrated version of a widely utilized protein–protein docking and binding affinity benchmark. This benchmark comprises non-redundant, high-quality structures of protein–protein complexes along with the unbound structures of their components. The update includes the addition of 55 new protein–protein complexes, of which 35 have experimentally measured binding affinities, resulting in a total of 230 entries for the docking benchmark and 179 entries for the affinity benchmark.

The composition of DB5.5 includes 55 new cases added to the docking benchmark, representing a 31% increase over the previous version, and 35 of these cases include experimental affinities that contribute to a 24% increase in the affinity benchmark. The inclusion of cases with multiple binding modes further enriches the benchmark.

The benchmark construction process involves collecting new structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using a semi-automatic pipeline. The inclusion criteria ensure high-quality complexes, and sequence-based pruning is applied to prevent cross-contamination between training and test sets. The DB5.5 dataset is considered a gold standard for protein interface prediction, providing a diverse set of examples, including enzyme-inhibitor and antibody-antigen interactions.
