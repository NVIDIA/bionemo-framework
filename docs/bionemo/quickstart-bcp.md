# Getting Started with BCP training 


NVIDIA Base Command Platform (BCP) includes a central user interface with a set of managed compute resources. It can be used to manage datasets, workspaces, and jobs, as well as users within an organization and team. This creates a convenient hub for monitoring job execution, viewing metrics and logs, and monitoring resource utilization. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is powered by Base Command Platform. 

More information and CLI documentation can be found on the [BCP website](https://docs.nvidia.com/base-command-platform/index.html).

Before beginning, NGC CLI must be installed and configured to perform command-line tasks. Visit the [NGC user guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/base-command-platform/user-guide/index.html#installing-ngc-cli) for instructions.
