# Running BioNeMo With BCP

## Introduction to BCP

NVIDIA Base Command Platform (BCP) includes a central user interface with a set of managed compute resources. It can be used to manage datasets, workspaces, and jobs, as well as users within an organization and team. This creates a convenient hub for monitoring job execution, viewing metrics and logs, and monitoring resource utilization. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is powered by Base Command Platform. 

More information and CLI documentation can be found on the [BCP website](https://docs.nvidia.com/base-command-platform/index.html).

Before beginning, NGC CLI must be installed and configured to perform command-line tasks. Visit the [NGC user guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/base-command-platform/user-guide/index.html#installing-ngc-cli) for instructions.

### Training BioNeMo Models with BCP

The following reference script can be used to launch a job on a cluster running BCP from a local workstation using the NGC CLI. The [NGC web UI](https://docs.nvidia.com/base-command-platform/user-guide/index.html#jobs-and-gpu-instances) can also be used to configure and launch the job interactively. The script has comments with additional info about the specific commands. The example scripts are also available in `/workspace/bionemo/examples/protein/esm1nv/scripts/` in the BioNeMo container. Similar scripts are available for ProtT5nv and MegaMolBART in their respective directories.

In the configuration below, update `{deploy_ngc_org}` and `{deploy_ngc_team}` with the correct NGC org and team name, respectively. If there is no team name, then this can be omitted.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NGC_ARRAY_SIZE=2                                    #number of nodes for the job

Alternatively, the cluster resource allocation can be acquired and then the model training can be launched interactively by accessing the allocated nodes. In this case, the training can be launched via NGC CLI. 


:::{note}
When employing the command line interface for interactive job launch example, it's possible that cached memory allocations may persist on the GPUs even after job termination. To resolve this issue, you can forcibly clear these allocations by executing the following command: 
``bcprun --cmd "pkill -9 python``

This command will effectively terminate any Python processes and clear any lingering GPU memory allocations.
:::


To use interactive shell interface, instead of launching the bcprun command shown in the example script above, the following command can be used to secure compute resources in interactive mode. 


```bash
ngc batch run \
  --name "example-training-1" \
  --org {deploy_ngc_org} \
  --team {deploy_ngc_team} \
  --instance dgxa100.80g.8.norm \
  --array-type PYTORCH \
  --replicas 2 \
  --image "{deploy_ngc_org_team}/{deploy_container_name}:{deploy_container_tag}" \     #Image path for BioNeMo
  --result /results \
  --workspace WORKSPACE_ID:/example_training:RW \
  --port 8888 \
  --datasetid DATASET_ID:/data/ \
  --total-runtime 1D \
  --preempt RUNONCE \
  --priority HIGH \
  --order 1 \
  --commandline "sleep infinity" 
```

Next, log into job using the NGC CLI for interactive development

```bash
ngc batch exec --ace ACE_NAME --org {deploy_ngc_org} --team {deploy_ngc_team} <JOB_ID> 
```

Once connected, you can execute the training run with `bcprun` command followed by the job launch arguments. 

## Data Management on BCP and DGX Cloud

NVIDIA Base Command Platform has the following data types on network storage within the ACE:

- **Result**: Private to a job, read-write artifact, automatically generated for each node in a job.

- **Dataset**: Shareable read-only artifact, mountable to a job.

- **Workspace**: Shareable read-write artifact, mountable to a job.

- **Local scratch space**: Private to a node read-write local scratch space only on full-node instances.

- **Secrets**: Encrypted tokens and passwords for 3rd-party authentication.

### Example Dataset Workflow

1. The data preprocessing step for training a BioNeMo model is done on CPU, thus it may be more resource efficient to perform on a workstation. Details on preprocessing the data are provided in the Quickstart Guide. The process entails downloading the dataset, performing any required cleaning, and then splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets.

2. Once preprocessing is completed, the data can be uploaded to NGC as a Dataset. Refer to the next section for a reference command. Datasets are a useful way to preserve the data in a read-only format.

3. However, BioNeMo must create index files and currently these index files need to reside in the same directory as the data files. This is described in the [Known issues](known-issues-fw.md). Thus, the newly created dataset should be copied to a workspace on the cluster before training is run. This will enable indexing to performed as workspaces are writable. 

## Useful BCP Commands

### Configure NGC Access

```bash
ngc config set
```

### Check Status of NGC

```bash
ngc diag [all,client,install,server,user]
```

### Check Job Status

```bash
ngc batch list
```

### Checking the Job Details

```bash
ngc batch info JOB_ID
```

### Uploading Data to a BCP Dataset

Check the NGC CLI documentation for additional details on naming, creating and sharing the dataset.

```bash
ngc dataset upload --source <dir> --desc "my data" <dataset_name> [--share <team_name>]
```

### Creating a Workspace

```bash
ngc workspace create --name <workspace-name>
```

### Downloading Output Files and Checkpoints

This command will download all data from the directory configured with the `--result` flag in the `ngc batch run` command. In the above examples, this is `/result`.

```bash
ngc result download <job-id[:replica-id]> --dest <download-path>
```
