        Without any task-specific fine‚Äëtuning and using only raw DNA sequences,
        Evo‚ÄØ2 can accurately predict the functional impact of clinically
        significant variants in the BRCA1 gene. In other words, Evo 2 can
        determine whether a particular single nucleotide variant of the BRCA1
        gene is likely to be harmful to the protein's function, and thus
        potentially increase the risk of cancer for the patient with the genetic
        variant.

          Multiple experiments were performed showcasing Evo 2's successful
          ability to predict the functional impact of genetic variants,

        functional/intermediate variants (ùëÅ = 3,070). These function scores
        reflect the extent by which the genetic variant has disrupted the

        <b>3. Zero‚Äëshot scoring.</b>
        <br />
        Without any additional training, Evo 2 evaluated each SNV by calculating
        log-likelihood scores for both the original (<i>wild-type</i>) sequences
        and the variant sequences. Higher likelihood scores indicated sequences
        that the model recognized as more "natural" or typical, based on the
        patterns and underlying genetic relationships learned during training.
        To quantify each variant's impact, a delta likelihood score was
        calculated:{' '}
        <span
          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
            __html: katexify(
              '\\Delta = \\log P(\\text{variant}) - \\log P(\\text{reference})',
              true
            ),
          }}
        />
        This delta score captures how much the variant changes the sequence
        likelihood relative to the <i>wild-type</i>. The key intuition is that
        disruptive variants should have lower likelihood scores than their
        reference sequences, resulting in negative delta scores. The more
        negative the delta, the more the model considers the variant to be
        "unnatural" or disruptive to normal genomic patterns.

        functional/intermediate variants is shown below
