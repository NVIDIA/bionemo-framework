## Project Overview

We are building an agent that manages a pretraining loop for an OpenGenome2 7B Llama3 model using TransformerEngine with FP8 Block Scaling. The agent's objective is to **maximize the number of layers running in FP8** while keeping pretraining accuracy within tolerance of a BF16 baseline. The agent does this by controlling a per-layer precision schedule and monitoring training metrics at regular intervals. Training runs for a fixed number of steps (`--num_train_steps=$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS`).

## Metrics

### Accuracy Metric: Perplexity (lower is better)

Perplexity is the primary accuracy metric: `perplexity = exp(loss)`. At every check-in, the agent compares current perplexity against the BF16 baseline perplexity at the same step using a relative tolerance. A check-in passes if: `current_perplexity - baseline_perplexity <= baseline_perplexity * (TOLERANCE_PCT / 100)`. This means the tolerance adapts to the scale of the perplexity — it is more lenient early in training when perplexity is high and volatile, and tighter later when perplexity has settled. Only perplexity failures trigger rollbacks.

**Important**: The OG2 training script logs `loss` to stdout and WandB but does NOT log perplexity directly. The agent must compute perplexity from the loss value: `perplexity = exp(loss)`.

### Performance Metric: Unpadded Tokens Per Second (higher is better)

Measures actual training throughput excluding padding tokens. The agent should log this at every check-in to confirm FP8 is yielding a throughput benefit. Throughput drops do NOT trigger rollbacks — they are logged for informational purposes only.

### Metric Retrieval (WandB Local Files)

The agent launches training as a background process with `num_train_steps=$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS` (the full target). Training runs continuously — the agent does NOT stop/restart at each check-in. Instead, it monitors WandB's local log files to read per-step metrics in near-real-time.

WandB writes run data to a local directory during training. The path is printed to stdout at launch:

```
wandb: Run data is saved locally in <training_script_dir>/wandb/run-<timestamp>-<run_id>
```

A symlink `<training_script_dir>/wandb/latest-run` always points to the active run.

The per-step metrics file is:

```
<training_script_dir>/wandb/latest-run/files/wandb-history.jsonl
```

Each line is a JSON object with all metrics logged at that step:

```json
{"train/global_step": 100, "train/loss": 2.72, "train/unpadded_tokens_per_second_per_gpu": 10035.6, ...}
```

**Agent monitoring loop:**

1. Launch training as a background process.
2. Poll `wandb-history.jsonl` periodically (e.g. every 30 seconds).
3. When a new line appears where `train/global_step` matches a check-in step (`$CHECKIN_INTERVAL` multiple), parse the metrics. Key WandB fields:
   - `train/global_step` — step number
   - `train/loss` — compute `perplexity = exp(loss)` (compare against baseline `"perplexity"`)
   - `train/unpadded_tokens_per_second_per_gpu` — throughput per GPU
4. Compare perplexity against baseline (see Check-ins below).
5. Pass → do nothing, let training continue.
6. Fail → kill the training process **IMMEDIATELY**, then perform LKG recovery (see Milestone 2), and relaunch with updated precision schedule.

If multiple new check-in steps appear between polls, process them in order (lowest step first). Kill on the **FIRST** failure — do not continue evaluating later steps. This ensures the LKG checkpoint hasn't been auto-deleted by `max_checkpoints` before the agent acts.

Since the agent `cd`'s into `$(dirname $TRAINING_SCRIPT)` before launching, the wandb directory is relative to that working directory.

### Stdout Metric Format

The OG2 `perf_logger.py` also outputs metrics at every `logger.frequency` steps to stdout in this format:

```
loss: 2.94, learning_rate: 3e-05, grad_norm: 1.23, step_time: 0.456, tokens_per_second_per_gpu: 4.85e+04, unpadded_tokens_per_second_per_gpu: 4.5e+04, total_unpadded_tokens_per_batch: 12345, gpu_memory_allocated_max_gb: 65.3, gpu_memory_allocated_mean_gb: 65.3, global_step: 100
```

Key fields to parse:

- `loss` — compute `perplexity = exp(loss)`
- `unpadded_tokens_per_second_per_gpu` — throughput metric
- `global_step` — current training step

______________________________________________________________________

## CLI Reference

### Base Training Command (OG2-7B on Lepton)

The agent constructs each training launch from this template. First `cd` into the training script directory, then run torchrun. Fields marked `← AGENT CONTROLS` are modified between launches; everything else stays fixed.

```bash
cd $(dirname $TRAINING_SCRIPT)
torchrun \
  --nproc_per_node=$NPROC_PER_NODE \
  --nnodes=$NNODES \
  --rdzv_backend=c10d \
  --rdzv_endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:$MASTER_PORT \
  $(basename $TRAINING_SCRIPT) \
  --config-name $CONFIG_NAME \
  num_train_steps=$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS \
  grad_acc_steps=$GRAD_ACC_STEPS \                                # ← FIXED (do NOT change)
  fp8_config.enabled=True \
  fp8_config.fp8_recipe=transformer_engine.common.recipe.Float8BlockScaling \
  fp8_config.fp8_format=E4M3 \
  fp8_layers='[2,3,4,...,31]' \                                   # ← AGENT CONTROLS
  quant_stats_config.enabled=<true|false> \                       # ← AGENT CONTROLS (see below)
  quant_stats_config.quant_stats_file=./fp8_debugging_stats.yaml \
  quant_stats_config.quant_log_dir=$WORKSPACE_ROOT/<run_name>/quant_stats \
  checkpoint.ckpt_dir=$CHECKPOINT_ROOT/<run_name> \               # ← FIXED (same dir for entire session)
  checkpoint.save_every_n_steps=$CHECKIN_INTERVAL \
  checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true \                        # ← FIXED (always true; auto-finds latest checkpoint)
  checkpoint.max_checkpoints=4 \
  checkpoint.save_final_model=true \
  hydra.run.dir=$WORKSPACE_ROOT/<run_name>/hydra_outputs \
  wandb.project=$WANDB_PROJECT \                                  # ← FIXED
  +wandb.group=<run_name> \                                       # ← FIXED (computed once at session start, never changes)
  wandb.name=<see naming convention below>                        # ← AGENT CONTROLS
```

**CRITICAL**: The agent must use this command template EXACTLY. Do NOT add, remove, or modify any parameters not marked `← AGENT CONTROLS`. In particular:

- Do NOT change `grad_acc_steps` — it is set in the Hydra config and must stay at $GRAD_ACC_STEPS
- Do NOT add `dataset.*`, `adamw_kwargs.*`, or `lr_scheduler_kwargs.*` overrides — these are already set in the Hydra config
- Do NOT scale any parameter by the number of nodes or GPUs
- `logger.frequency` is set in the Hydra config (every step) — do NOT override it

**Notes on OG2 vs ESM2 differences:**

- **No `fp4_config` or `fp4_layers`** — FP4 is not used for OG2 FP8 Block Scaling
- **Only `fp8_layers`** controls which layers run in FP8; layers absent from the list default to BF16
- The `og2_7b_thd_gqa_fp8` config already sets: `use_sequence_packing=true`, `use_fp32_master_weights=true`, `spike_no_more_embedding_init=true`, `use_megatron_scaled_init=true`, `dataset.*`, `adamw_kwargs.*`, `lr_scheduler_kwargs.*`, `logger.frequency=1`, `grad_acc_steps=8`
- **Do NOT override** any Hydra config values that are not in the template above — the config is carefully tuned
- Multi-node Lepton: `MASTER_ADDR`/`MASTER_PORT` are provided by the Lepton environment

The agent modifies these fields between launches:

- `fp8_layers` — updated based on the current precision schedule
- `wandb.name` — updated to reflect the current precision schedule (see naming convention below)
- `quant_stats_config.enabled` — `true` for `research_guided` only; `false` for `ends_in` and `tail_in`

These fields are FIXED for the entire session (never change between launches):

- `grad_acc_steps` — always `$GRAD_ACC_STEPS` (do NOT scale by nodes/GPUs — FSDP handles distributed scaling)
- `checkpoint.ckpt_dir` — always `$CHECKPOINT_ROOT/<run_name>` (same directory for the entire session; matches Lepton job name and wandb group)
- `num_train_steps` — always `$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS` (absolute target)
- `checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint` — always `true` (the script auto-finds the latest checkpoint; on first launch with no checkpoints it starts fresh automatically)
- `+wandb.group` — always `<run_name>` (computed once at session start, never changes)

### Layer Precision Control

Precision is controlled via a single list:

- `fp8_layers=[2,3,...,31]` — layers running in FP8 Block Scaling
- Layers NOT in `fp8_layers` default to BF16

Embedding and lm_head are always in BF16 (not addressable via `fp8_layers`). The agent only manages transformer block layer indices 1-32 (1-indexed). A layer cannot appear in `fp8_layers` and also be in BF16 — its presence or absence in the list is the control.

When using FP8, the recipe config must also be passed:

```
fp8_config.enabled=True
fp8_config.fp8_recipe=transformer_engine.common.recipe.Float8BlockScaling
fp8_config.fp8_format=E4M3
fp8_layers=[...]
```

### WandB Run Naming Convention

The agent must set `wandb.name` dynamically on each launch to reflect the current precision schedule. Format:

```
og2-7b-fp8-<fp8_range>-strat-<strategy>
```

Examples:

- All 32 layers in FP8: `og2-7b-fp8-1-32-strat-ends_in`
- Layers 3-30 in FP8: `og2-7b-fp8-3-30-strat-ends_in`
- No FP8 (all BF16): `og2-7b-fp8-none-strat-ends_in`
- Non-contiguous: `og2-7b-fp8-28layers-strat-research_guided`

Each new training launch (after demotion/recovery) gets a new wandb run name reflecting the updated schedule.

### WandB Run Grouping

`+wandb.group` is set to `<run_name>` (e.g. `ends_in_20260317_143000`). This is computed ONCE at session start and NEVER changes — every relaunch within the session uses the same group value. Only `wandb.name` changes between launches. This groups all the fragmented runs together in the WandB dashboard so you can:

- Filter by group to see only runs from one agent session
- Overlay all runs from a session on a single panel to see the full training trajectory (including rollbacks and demotions)

In WandB, go to the Runs table → Group by "Group" → expand a group to see the individual segments overlaid on shared axes.

### Checkpointing & Resume

The training script has built-in checkpoint support. To enable:

```
checkpoint.ckpt_dir=$CHECKPOINT_ROOT/<run_name>
checkpoint.save_every_n_steps=$CHECKIN_INTERVAL
checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true
```

To resume after a stop or crash, re-run the exact same command. The script automatically finds the latest `step_*` checkpoint in `checkpoint.ckpt_dir`, restores state, and resumes from step + 1.

**What gets restored on resume:**

- Model weights, optimizer state (AdamW moments), LR scheduler, step counter, epoch counter

**NOT restored:**

- Dataloader position (`use_stateful_dataloader` currently disabled)

**Key behavior:**

- `num_train_steps` is an absolute target, not relative. Resuming at step 400 with `num_train_steps=$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS` trains steps 401–`$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS`.
- `checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=false` forces a fresh start even if checkpoints exist.
- Checkpoints are saved as `<ckpt_dir>/train_fsdp2/step_<N>/`.

Additional checkpoint flags:

```
checkpoint.max_checkpoints=4         # keep 4 most recent (buffer so LKG isn't auto-deleted before agent can act)
checkpoint.save_final_model=true     # save .safetensors at end of training
```

LKG recovery: the agent deletes any checkpoint newer than the LKG from `$CHECKPOINT_ROOT/<run_name>/train_fsdp2/`. Since `checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true` always, the training script auto-finds the latest remaining checkpoint (the LKG) and resumes from there. The `checkpoint.ckpt_dir` never changes.

### Quantization Stats Logging

TransformerEngine provides per-layer quantization statistics (underflow %, scale_inv_min, scale_inv_max, MSE). These are **only used by the `research_guided` strategy**.

When enabled (`research_guided` only), these flags apply:

```
quant_stats_config.enabled=true
quant_stats_config.quant_stats_file=./fp8_debugging_stats.yaml
quant_stats_config.quant_log_dir=$WORKSPACE_ROOT/<run_name>/quant_stats
```

Stats are logged to `<quant_log_dir>/rank_*/nvdlfw_inspect_statistics_logs/`. Logging frequency is controlled via the `freq` parameter in the stats YAML config. Available stats for FP8 Block Scaling:

- `underflows%` — percentage of non-zero elements rounded to zero after quantization
- `scale_inv_min` / `scale_inv_max` — range of inverse scaling factors across blocks
- `mse` — mean squared error between quantized and original tensor

These are collected per layer, per tensor type (activation, gradient, weight).

For `ends_in` and `tail_in`: set `quant_stats_config.enabled=false`. These strategies use deterministic demotion orders and do not need runtime quant signals.

Reference implementation: `quantization.py` in this recipe directory.

______________________________________________________________________

## Precision Levels

For OG2 FP8 Block Scaling, there are only **two precision levels**:

```
FP8 (Float8BlockScaling E4M3)  →  BF16
```

Demotion is always FP8 → BF16. There is no intermediate level.

______________________________________________________________________

## Promotion Strategies

The agent uses `PROMOTION_STRATEGY` to decide which layers to **demote from FP8 to BF16** when a check-in fails. Three strategies are available:

### Strategy 1: `ends_in` (default)

Demote `LAYERS_PER_PROMOTION` layers per failed check-in, working inward from both ends simultaneously:

```
Failure 1: demote layers 1, 32    (outermost pair)
Failure 2: demote layers 2, 31
Failure 3: demote layers 3, 30
Failure 4: demote layers 4, 29
...continuing inward...
Last: layers 16, 17              (very center, last to be demoted)
```

**Rationale**: Edge layers (closest to embedding input and projection output) are more sensitive to quantization error. Middle layers are most tolerant. Never demote from the middle outward.

See [OG2_STRATEGY_ENDS_IN.md](OG2_STRATEGY_ENDS_IN.md) for full pseudocode, demotion table, and worked example.

### Strategy 2: `tail_in`

Demote `LAYERS_PER_PROMOTION` layers per failed check-in, starting from the last layer and working toward the first. The agent decides how many total layers to demote — there is no fixed cap.

```
Failure 1: demote layers 32, 31   (last 2 layers)
Failure 2: demote layers 30, 29   (next 2 toward head)
Failure 3: demote layers 28, 27
...continuing toward layer 1...
```

**Rationale**: The final layers of a transformer (closest to the output projection) are typically most sensitive to quantization error. Demoting from the tail inward addresses the most sensitive layers first.

See [OG2_STRATEGY_TAIL_IN.md](OG2_STRATEGY_TAIL_IN.md) for full pseudocode, demotion table, and worked example.

### Strategy 3: `research_guided`

This is the **only strategy that enables quant stats logging**. Set `quant_stats_config.enabled=true` in the training command.

Use the quant stats (underflow %, scale_inv_min, scale_inv_max, MSE) to collect per-layer sensitivity signals at runtime. The agent should:

1. Run an initial segment (e.g. first `CHECKIN_INTERVAL` steps) with all layers in FP8 and quant stats enabled.
2. Collect quant stats and identify which layers show the highest underflow/MSE.
3. When a check-in fails, demote the layers with the worst quant stats first (rather than following a fixed geometric pattern).
4. Document in `report.md` how the demotion order was derived from the runtime quant stats, and how it differs from `ends_in` / `tail_in`.

This strategy is exploratory. The agent has freedom to define the demotion order based on runtime quant stats, but must still respect the check-in / rollback loop and log all decisions to `history.json` and `report.md`.

______________________________________________________________________

## Check-ins

Every `CHECKIN_INTERVAL` training steps, the agent performs a check-in:

1. **Record** the current perplexity: `current_perplexity = exp(loss)`.
2. **Look up** the BF16 baseline perplexity for this step from `BASELINE_LOGFILE`.
3. **Compute tolerance** for this step: `allowed_delta = baseline_perplexity * (TOLERANCE_PCT / 100)`.
4. **Pass** if: `current_perplexity - baseline_perplexity <= allowed_delta`.
5. **Log** current `unpadded_tokens_per_second_per_gpu` for performance tracking.
6. **Pass** → do nothing, let training continue.
7. **Fail** → kill the training process, update precision schedule (demote `LAYERS_PER_PROMOTION` layers using `PROMOTION_STRATEGY`), and trigger recovery (Milestone 2).

**IMPORTANT**: `CHECKIN_INTERVAL` must align with the baseline logfile step intervals (both are 100 steps). If the agent attempts a check-in at a step that does not exist in the baseline logfile, it must immediately stop and report the error to the user (e.g. "Baseline logfile has no entry for step\_\<N>. Check that CHECKIN_INTERVAL aligns with the baseline step intervals."). Do not interpolate or skip — fail hard.

### Configuration

All tunable values are defined in the "Run Variables" block at the top of this document. The agent must read those values at startup. The two metrics are fixed:

- **Accuracy metric**: perplexity (lower is better)
- **Performance metric**: unpadded_tokens_per_sec (higher is better)

______________________________________________________________________

## Baseline Reference Logfile

Before any agent-managed training begins, a full BF16 baseline run must be completed. The baseline logfile contains per-step metrics at 100-step intervals:

```json
{
  "step_100":  {"perplexity": 6.04, "loss": 1.80, "unpadded_tokens_per_sec": 9013},
  "step_200":  {"perplexity": 4.16, "loss": 1.42, "unpadded_tokens_per_sec": 10047},
  "step_300":  {"perplexity": 4.09, "loss": 1.41, "unpadded_tokens_per_sec": 10075},
  ...
}
```

The agent loads this file at startup. At every check-in it looks up the baseline perplexity for the current step and logs both baseline and current values. The logfile path is provided via config — do not generate baseline values within the agent loop.

______________________________________________________________________

## Milestone 1: Pretraining Agent Loop

### Agent Objective

Run as many layers as possible in FP8 while keeping perplexity within tolerance of the BF16 baseline. Start with all 32 transformer block layers in `$INITIAL_PRECISION`. Demote layers to BF16 only when check-ins fail. Stop after `$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS` steps.

### Layer Precision Schedule

The agent maintains a per-layer precision map for transformer block layers only:

```python
# OG2-7B: 32 transformer block layers (1-32, 1-indexed)
layer_precision = {i: "fp8" for i in range(1, 33)}
```

This map translates directly to the `fp8_layers` CLI argument:

```python
fp8_layers = sorted(k for k, v in layer_precision.items() if v == "fp8")
# Layers not in fp8_layers default to BF16
```

### Precision Levels & Demotion Mechanics

Demotion is always FP8 → BF16. When a check-in fails, the agent removes the selected layers from `fp8_layers` (layers absent from the list default to BF16). Example: `fp8_layers=[1,2,3,...,32]` becomes `fp8_layers=[2,3,...,31]` after demoting layers 1 and 32.

## Milestone 2: Model Persistence & Recovery

### Saving Checkpoints

The agent uses the built-in checkpoint system (see "Checkpointing & Resume" above). Set `checkpoint.save_every_n_steps` to match `$CHECKIN_INTERVAL` so that a checkpoint exists at every check-in step. The most recent checkpoint that passed a check-in is the "last known good" (LKG).

The agent must also persist alongside each checkpoint:

- The current `fp8_layers` list (the layer precision schedule)

(Model weights, optimizer state, LR scheduler, step counter, and RNG states are handled by the built-in checkpoint system. Each new training launch creates a new WandB run — runs are grouped via `+wandb.group`.)

### Recovery on Failed Check-in

1. Kill the current training process.
2. Delete any checkpoint newer than the LKG from the checkpoint directory (e.g. if LKG is `step_400` and `step_500` exists, delete `step_500`). This ensures the script resumes from the LKG on relaunch.
3. Demote `LAYERS_PER_PROMOTION` layers using `PROMOTION_STRATEGY`. Update `fp8_layers` accordingly.
4. Relaunch training with the updated precision schedule. Do NOT change `num_train_steps` — keep it at `$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS`. The checkpoint stores the step counter; the script automatically loads the LKG, reads the step from it, and resumes toward the same target. `checkpoint.ckpt_dir` stays the same — the script auto-finds the latest remaining checkpoint (the LKG).

The agent discards all training progress since the last successful check-in. The assumption is that divergence started after the LKG point and the updated schedule will prevent it from recurring.

### Recovery Flow Example

```
Check-in fails at step 200 (current_ppl - baseline_ppl > allowed_delta)
→ Kill training
→ Delete step_200 checkpoint
→ Demote layers 1, 32: FP8 → BF16 (ends_in, first demotion)
→ Update fp8_layers to exclude [1, 32]
→ Relaunch (script auto-resumes from step_100)
→ Next check-in at step 200 (re-do this interval)

Check-in fails again at step 200
→ Kill training
→ Delete step_200 checkpoint
→ Demote layers 2, 31: FP8 → BF16 (second demotion)
→ Update fp8_layers to exclude [1, 2, 31, 32]
→ Relaunch from step_100
→ ...
```

## Milestone 3: Code Intervention Mode (Optional)

Beyond adjusting the layer precision schedule, the agent can optionally be granted permission to **edit the training and model code itself** to fix precision/casting issues it discovers during training. This mode is opt-in — by default the agent must ONLY control behavior via CLI arguments.

### When to Intervene

The agent should consider code intervention when:

- **NaN/Inf loss detected** — likely a casting or autocast bug
- **Loss spikes that don't correlate with precision schedule changes** — may indicate a code-level issue
- **Quant stats show anomalous patterns** across all layers (not just specific ones) — suggests a systematic bug
- **Training crashes** with CUDA errors, dtype mismatches, or TE assertion failures

### What the Agent Can Edit

Files the agent is allowed to modify:

- `opengenome_modeling_llama_te.py` — autocast contexts, `get_layer_autocast()`, `set_recipes()`
- `train_fsdp2.py` — recipe creation, FSDP wrapping, precision schedule application
- `quantization.py` — layer precision resolution logic

### Example Interventions

1. **Fix autocast nesting**: If the agent detects that FP8 layers have a double-nested autocast (outer FP8 + inner FP8), it can fix `get_layer_autocast()` to return `nullcontext()` for FP8 layers.

2. **Fix recipe serialization**: If recipes are lost after FSDP wrapping, the agent can add/fix the `set_recipes()` call.

3. **Fix dtype casting**: If embeddings or the lm_head are accidentally running in FP8, the agent can verify and fix the `te.autocast(enabled=False)` wrappers.

4. **Fix loss computation precision**: If loss is computed in FP8 (causing NaN), the agent can ensure the loss function runs in BF16/FP32.

### Guardrails

- The agent must **log every code change** to `history.json` with a diff and rationale.
- Code changes must be **committed to a branch** (not just edited in place) so they can be reviewed.
- The agent should **never modify the dataset, tokenizer, or optimizer code** — only precision-related code paths.
- After any code edit, the agent must **restart training from the LKG checkpoint** (not continue from current state).

## Agent Workspace & Artifacts

All agent output must be saved under: `$WORKSPACE_ROOT/<run_name>/`

The agent creates `<run_name>` ONCE at startup using the format: `<strategy>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>`
This value is computed once and stored — it does NOT change across relaunches within the same session. It is used for the checkpoint directory name, workspace directory, WandB group name, Lepton job name, and results folder — all the same value for easy cross-referencing.
Examples:

- `ends_in_20260317_143000`
- `tail_in_20260317_160000`
- `research_guided_20260318_091500`

The directory layout:

```
$CHECKPOINT_ROOT/<run_name>/    # model checkpoints (set checkpoint.ckpt_dir here)
  train_fsdp2/step_<N>/         # auto-created by the training script

$WORKSPACE_ROOT/<run_name>/
  logs/                         # training stdout/stderr logs from each launch
  quant_stats/                  # quantization stats output (research_guided only)
  configs/                      # copy of every config/CLI invocation used per segment
  graphs/                       # any plots the agent generates (perplexity vs baseline, throughput over time, etc.)
  history.json                  # structured log of all agent decisions:
                                #   - every check-in result (step, baseline ppl, current ppl, pass/fail)
                                #   - every demotion event (which layers, reason)
                                #   - every recovery event (rolled back to which step, new schedule)
                                #   - throughput at each check-in
  state.json                    # agent state for crash recovery
  report.md                     # human-readable summary maintained by the agent (see below)
```

  "wandb_group": "ends_in_20260317_143000"
}
```

### report.md

The agent must maintain a `report.md` in the run directory. Update it after every check-in and at the end of training. It should contain:

- Run metadata: model name, num_layers, num_train_steps, tolerance, start time
- Final precision schedule: which layers ended in FP8 vs BF16
- Summary of all check-in results (table or list: step, baseline ppl, current ppl, pass/fail)
- Summary of all demotions and rollbacks
- Throughput comparison: average unpadded tokens/sec across the run vs. the BF16 baseline average
- Any observations from quant stats (research_guided only: layers with high underflow/overflow)
- Conclusion: how many layers stayed in FP8, overall accuracy vs baseline, throughput gain/loss

### Final Report

At the end of your session (or when training completes), you MUST produce a full markdown-based final report. Create a folder inside `$RESULTS_FOLDER` with the strategy name and date, and save all deliverables there:

```
$RESULTS_FOLDER/<strategy>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/
  report.md                     # the final polished report
  graphs/                       # copies of all graphs referenced in the report
  history.json                  # copy of the run's history.json for reference
```

The folder name must be unique (strategy + timestamp) because these experiments will be run multiple times and results must not overwrite each other.

The final report should be a polished, self-contained document that includes everything from the run's `report.md` plus:

- A high-level executive summary (2-3 paragraphs) suitable for sharing with the team
- Graphs and visualizations (saved to graphs/ and referenced in the report), including at minimum:
  - **Perplexity over training steps**: baseline BF16 perplexity vs. this run's perplexity plotted on the same axes, with the tolerance band shaded. Mark any check-in failure points and demotion events on the plot.
  - **Throughput over training steps**: unpadded tokens/sec for this run vs. the BF16 baseline.
- Comparison against the BF16 baseline with concrete numbers
- Recommendations for next steps (e.g. try a different strategy, adjust tolerance, change layers_per_promotion)
- Any lessons learned or surprising findings during the run

The run-level `report.md` (inside the run directory) is a living document updated during training. The final report in `$RESULTS_FOLDER` is the cleaned-up deliverable produced at the end.

## Key Constraints

1. The agent is an **outer loop** around the training script. It configures precision, launches training, evaluates, and decides what to do next. Unless Milestone 3 (Code Intervention Mode) is explicitly enabled, the agent must ONLY control behavior via CLI arguments — do NOT modify the training script, config files, or any other source code.
2. All config (tolerance_pct, interval, baseline logfile path, layers_per_promotion) must be **passed via config** — not hardcoded.
3. All artifacts (checkpoints, logs, configs, graphs, history, report) go under `$WORKSPACE_ROOT/<run_name>/`. Final deliverables go under `$RESULTS_FOLDER/<strategy>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/`.
4. WandB logging is desirable: training metrics should be published to WandB when available, but WandB failures should not block the agent loop.
5. The agent stops after reaching `$NUM_TRAIN_STEPS`. If all layers have been demoted to BF16 before that point, continue training in full BF16 for the remaining steps.
6. **Lepton-specific**: The agent must handle multi-node torchrun setup, NFS paths for checkpoints/data, and Lepton environment variables for distributed training.
