# ESM-2 (TransformerEngine-Optimized) Overview

## Description:

ESM-2 is a state-of-the-art protein model trained on a masked language modelling objective. It predicts protein
structures from amino acid sequences, leveraging a transformer-based architecture for accurate 3D modeling. It is
suitable for fine-tuning on a wide range of tasks that take protein sequences as input.

This version of the ESM-2 model is optimized with NVIDIA's
[TransformerEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) library. It is based on the original ESM-2 model from
Facebook Research, and (within numerical precision) has identical weights and outputs.

This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

### License/Terms of Use:

ESM-2 is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/LICENSE).

### Deployment Geography:

Global

### Use Case:

Protein structure prediction, specifically predicting 3D protein structures from amino acid sequences.

### Release Date:

Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIAâ€™s hardware
(e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times
compared to CPU-only solutions.

The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific
data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at
both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure
compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.

## Model Version: This model features the following version/checkpoints:

Several ESM-2 checkpoints are available with varying sizes. Larger sizes have better accuracy, but require more memory
and time to train:

## Training and Evaluation Datasets:

## Training Datasets:

**Link:** [UniRef90](https://www.uniprot.org/uniref?query=%28identity%3A0.9%29)

**Data Modality:**

- Text (Protein Sequences)

**Text Training Data Size:**

- 1 Billion to 10 Trillion Tokens

**Data Collection Method:**

- Human

**Labeling Method:**

- N/A

**Properties (Quantity, Dataset Descriptions, Sensor(s)):** UniRef90 clusters are generated from the UniRef100 seed
sequences with a 90% sequence identity threshold using the MMseqs2 algorithm. The seed sequences are the longest members
of the UniRef100 cluster. However, the longest sequence is not always the most informative. There is often more
biologically relevant information and annotation (name, function, cross-references) available on other cluster members.
All the proteins in each cluster are ranked to facilitate the selection of a biologically relevant representative for
the cluster.

**Data Modality:**

- Text (Protein Sequences)

**Text Training Data Size:**

- 1 Billion to 10 Trillion Tokens

**Data Collection Method:**

- Human

**Labeling Method:**

- N/A

**Properties:** UniRef50 clusters are generated from the UniRef90 seed sequences with a 50% sequence identity threshold
using the MMseqs2 algorithm. The seed sequences are the longest members of the UniRef90 cluster. However, the longest
sequence is not always the most informative. There is often more biologically relevant information and annotation (name,
function, cross-references) available on other cluster members. All the proteins in each cluster are ranked to
facilitate the selection of a biologically relevant representative for the cluster.

## Evaluation Datasets:

**Link:** [Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8673552/)

**Benchmark Score:** {{ cameo_score }}

**Data Collection Method:**

- Human

**Labeling Method:**

- N/A

**Properties:** The data is collected by taking sequences of protein structures that are about to be released weekly by
the Protein Data Bank (PDB). These sequences are sent as "blind targets" to participating protein structure prediction
servers, which then return their predictions.

**Link:** [CASP14 (Critical Assessment of Methods of Protein Structure Prediction)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34533838/)

**Benchmark Score:** {{ casp14_score }}

**Data Collection Method:**

- Human

**Labeling Method:**

- N/A

**Properties:** The data for CASP14 targets is collected from protein structures that are newly solved by experimental
structural biologists. The CASP organizers receive the amino acid sequences of these proteins before their full,
three-dimensional structures are publicly released in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). They then provide these sequences to
participating research groups and servers, who must submit their predicted structures within a specific time frame.
