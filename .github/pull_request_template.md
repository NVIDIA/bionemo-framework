#### Authorizing CI Runs

We use [copy-pr-bot](https://docs.gha-runners.nvidia.com/apps/copy-pr-bot/#automation) to manage authorization of CI
runs on NVIDIA's compute resources.

* If a pull request is opened by a trusted user and contains only trusted changes, the pull request's code will
  automatically be copied to a pull-request/ prefixed branch in the source repository (e.g. pull-request/123)
* If a pull request is opened by an untrusted user or contains untrusted changes, an NVIDIA org member must leave an
  `/ok to test` comment on the pull request to trigger CI. This will need to be done for each new commit.
