    """Prompt user via STDIN for a boolean response: 'yes'/'y' is True and 'no'/'n' is False.

    Note that the input gathered from STDIN is stripped of all surrounding whitespace and converted to lowercase.
    While the user is prompted on STDOUT to supply 'y' or 'n', note that 'yes' and 'no' are accepted, respectively.
    An affirmative response ('yes' or 'y') will result in True being returned. A negative response ('no' or 'n')
    results in a False being returned.

    This function loops forever until it reads an unambiguous affirmative ('y') or negative ('n') response via STDIN.

    Args:
        message: Added to the STDOUT prompt for the user.

    Returns:
        True if user responds in the affirmative via STDIN. False if user responds in the negative.

    Raises:
        ValueError iff message is the empty string or only consists of whitespace.
