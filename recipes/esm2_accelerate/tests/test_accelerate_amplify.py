These are tests for the AMPLIFY model, an ESM-2 variant with a modified different architecture and tokenizer. See
https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.23.614603 and huggingface.co/chandar-lab/amplify_350m for more details. Note: in these
tests, we don't test the original xformers-based model, since we don't install xformers in our base image for these
recipe tests.
