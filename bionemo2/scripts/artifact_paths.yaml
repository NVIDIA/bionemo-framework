# This file specifies the source locations of pretrained models, and what
# the target locations to which they should be downloaded.
#
# The model source can be from either NGC (for internal nvidia + external customer use)
# or from SwiftStack (aka PBSS) for internal nvidia use.
#
# The download_models.py script requires the download directory be specified, but there
# are two extra parameters here that can further specify what to do with the downloaded file.
# "symlink" is used to specify if any symlinking operation needs to happen after download.
# "relative_download_dir" is used to specify the subdirectory to which the files should
# be downloaded.
# "extra_args" specifies any extra arguments that should be passed the ngc download or
# s3 download commands.
#
# All models with an `ngc` path are publically available. Those with only a `pbss` path
# are currently in internal NVIDIA development.
