"""Format of I/O for Triton inference functions: a collection of possibly batched arrays, identified by names.

Note that for a Triton model service, all of the underlying model's output tensors must be named and provided
at bind/model load time in the `outputs` configuration.

Note that this is the same for inputs: Triton model services accept a (again, possibly batched) set of named tensors
that shall be input directly into the model.

 The `@batch` decorator from PyTriton provides unwrapping support into arguments directly. I.e. for a model
 that accepts input:
 ```json
 {
   "sequences": [...],
   "mask": [...]
 }
 ```

 This is a valid inference function:
 ```python
 def infer_fn(tensors: Dict[str, np.ndarray]):
   # both will be present
   sequence: np.ndarray = tensors['sequence']
   mask: np.ndarray = tensors['mask']
   # and the values will be the input teneors
   # they will *ALL* either have a batch dimension or not,
   # depending on the way the model config was set up (i.e. was there a batch dimension in the model spec?)
   return real_infer_fn(sequence, mask)
```

Using `@batch` lets us write the following
```python
@batch
def infer_batched(sequence: np.ndarray, mask: np.ndarray):
  # sequence and mask are equivalent to our dict accesses above
  # implementation is now *EXACTLY EQUIVALENT* to `infer_fn` after this point
  return real_infer_fn(sequence, mask)
```

Thus, `@batch` is simply a convenience wrapper for not having to manually obtain the named input tensors.
